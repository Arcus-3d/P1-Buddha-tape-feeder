The [Arcus-3D-P1 Buddha tape feeder](https://hackaday.io/project/159792) is open source hardware. This github repository hosts the [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org) source and the rendered STL images for quick access.

If you are the 'blazing forward without instructions' type, the minimum you need to know is: Print these STL files using a 0.3mm nozzle on a relatively well tuned 3D printer. For further instructions and caveats, see [the web page](https://hackaday.io/project/159792).
